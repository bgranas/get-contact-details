== README

A tool built in Ruby and Rails to gather contact information from a given URL. It is very useful for sales prospecting or public relations outreach. As it is currently built, it is set up to gather information on travel accommodation providers, but it can be configured to pull info on any site.

The tool takes in a list of URLs as input, and returns the contact email address, URLs of the Contact Us or About Us pages, and URLs of the site's Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube profiles.

To Do:
* Enhanced email regex
